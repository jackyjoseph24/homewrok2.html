  <p>I’m just a regular guy who had an idea about an app that he wanted to build and manage himself. I was referred by a friend from my current job about this UCF BootCamp program. I was told before that it will not be easy but “wow” they weren’t lying. Especially, coming from no background and experience from coding. If I didn’t know why I was doing it for, I probably would’ve dropped or quit this course until at least I can have a completely understanding the basic of everything. I got a 2 and half years old daughter that I would love to give everything she wants and for that reason I’m willing to keep on going even if it’s a rough start.</p>
